* This is a joke

* Introduction
The web sux, need i say more?
** IT SUCKS
**** HTML:
=angle-bracket=

<<<exx em ell>>>

=angle-bracket=

/something something something/ *tags*
**** CSS:
Every programmer is /obviously/ an Epistomologist.
  
Because /everyone/ wanted to consider the true nature of what makes /a style/ *style*

Stop, colors aren't objects. Just let me center a div, *goddamn!*
**** JavaScript:
"ookay, so we load a 4 megabyte script to make my 2.71 megabyte website load faster?"

"that's... /a trade off/"
* Clojure GUD:

*** IT JUST IS!
