   - *Date:* [The grind never stops]

   - *Author:* [The Srcerizder]
     
** Introduction
- Intended as an +autistic+ /artistic/ personal replacement for Linktr.ee

- This can be thought of as a form of interweb portfolio.

- It is intentionally dated looking, and minimal. I *will not* be modernizing this to look like =generic_template.css=

- /I won't provide support for any issues on your machine, as this is a pet project./

*** Why Clojure?
- /Because funy/
  
- /Because I can/
  
- /Because I didn't like raw editing my html+css/
